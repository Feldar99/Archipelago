## Configuring your YAML File
### What is a YAML and why do I need one?
An YAML file is the way that you provide your player options to Archipelago.
See the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here on the Archipelago website to learn more.

### Where do I get a YAML?
You can use the [game options page for Guild Wars 2](/games/Guild%20Wars%202/player-options) here on the Archipelago 
website to generate a YAML using a graphical interface.

## Hints and other commands
While playing in a multiworld, you can interact with the server using various commands listed in the 
[commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). You can use the Archipelago Text Client to do this,
which is included in the latest release of the [Archipelago software](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest).
