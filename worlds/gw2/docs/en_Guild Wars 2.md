# Guild Wars 2

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Players are not allowed to use parts of their builds until they are unlocked. This has to be tracked manually since
this is an MMO, but there is a BlishHUD mod to help keep track of it.  What parts of your build are locked are customizable in the YAML, as are the
the things you can do to unlock multiworld items. The mod also regularly polls the web API for unlocks.

## What Guild Wars 2 items can appear in other players' worlds?

This is customizable in the YAML, but some examples include weapon types, armor slots, sklls, and traits.

## What does another world's item look like in Guild Wars 2?

The BlishHUD mod has a list of achievements, story chapters, world bosses, and skill unlocks that you should do to
unlock items and tracks the progress towards these objectives.
